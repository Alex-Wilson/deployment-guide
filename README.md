# Web Deployment for Dummies by Dummies


# Purpose

_"If we have our own why in life, we shall get along with almost any how."_  
â€” [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche)

It is likely that no-one will ever read this but I still want to share :) This is a document to guide anyone to setup a web server and a website at a given domain name.

Making a website is both an art and a science. It will be difficult work to build anything the first time. It will be 10x harder to build something worth using. It will be 100x more difficult to build something that solves a problem and is profitable, culturally significant, or groundbreaking. My advice is to be proud of what you are building from the very start. Create something new or remake something the way you wanted it, but build **something**. Practice is the only path to mastery.
# Email
We should practice compartmentalization and use a new email address for our website and all of the associated services with it. While it might seem strange to use single email for multiple accounts, if each password is strong and different we should be okay for most use cases. Lets look at some of the more reputable email services in 2025.

	- **Overall:** The most widely used email service known for its integration with Google Workspace apps and generous free storage (15 GB shared across services).

# Hosting Provider
A **web hosting provider** is a service that stores your website's files and makes them accessible on the internet. Think of it as renting space on a server, which is like a digital home for your website. Hosting providers manage the technical infrastructure so that your site is always available to visitors.

There are various types of hosting:

- **Shared Hosting**: Multiple websites share the same server, making it affordable but less customizable.
- **Cloud Hosting**: A scalable solution that uses multiple servers to handle traffic spikes effectively.
- **Dedicated Hosting**: A server reserved entirely for your website, providing maximum performance and control.
