# Purpose

_"If we have our own why in life, we shall get along with almost any how."_  
â€” [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche)

It is likely that no-one will ever read this but I still want to share :) This is a document to guide anyone to setup a web server and a website at a given domain name.

Making a website is both an art and a science. It will be difficult work to build anything the first time. It will be 10x harder to build something worth using. It will be 100x more difficult to build something that solves a problem and is profitable, culturally significant, or groundbreaking. My advice is to be proud of what you are building from the very start. Create something new or remake something the way you wanted it, but build **something**. Practice is the only way to learn.
